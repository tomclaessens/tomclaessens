🚀 I'm a scrum master and agile advocate for outdoor and fashion retailer [A.S. Adventure](https://www.asadventure.com).

In my spare time I like to tinker and write about technology, work on my ever growing [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) setup or practice [photography](https://tomclaessens.be).

*Adventure is not a destination or an activity. It is a positive attitude, a way of living your life more consciously. Daring to leave the seemingly safe path and continually discovering new things.  In every aspect of your life.*

Because “**Adventure is everywhere**”.
